Sure, I can help you with that. Here is the README.md file for the code you provided:

## Sidcup Family Golf

This is a website for a golf course in Sidcup, South East London. The website features a hero image with a video of the course, a navigation bar with links to different pages, a section with information about the course, and a section with a scrolling animation of the different services offered by the course.

## Technologies Used

The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The video is hosted on a third-party server and is loaded using the `<video>` element. The navigation bar is created using flexbox and the scrolling animation is created using CSS animations.

## Instructions

To view the website, open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Code Snippets

Here are some code snippets from the website:

```html
<video autoplay loop muted src="https://sidcupfamilygolf.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/hero.mp4"></video>
```

This code snippet loads the video from a third-party server and plays it automatically in a loop.

```css
.scrolls {
    white-space: nowrap;
    overflow: hidden;
    position: relative;
    z-index: 8;
}

.scrolls-animation {
    display: inline-block;
    white-space: nowrap;
    animation: scroll 20s linear infinite;
}
```

This code snippet creates the scrolling animation. The `.scrolls` class is used to set the white-space and overflow properties, and the `.scrolls-animation` class is used to apply the animation.

## Conclusion

This website is a great example of how to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a visually appealing and interactive website. The use of flexbox for the navigation bar and CSS animations for the scrolling animation make the website easy to navigate and engaging to look at.
